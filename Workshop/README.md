<br> 

**Soldering the Pi Pico to the PCB** <br>
1. Lay the main PCB on your workbench as shown with the PicoBoy Name up. <br>
2. Remove the Raspberry Pi Pico 40 pin microcontroller from its packaging<br>
3. Lay the Pi Pico so it is laying as shown in the picture above on the PCB<br>
4. Optional: You can apply tape to hold it down if needed, but leave at least 1 corner pin uncovered <br>
5. Solder 1 corner pin and check that the Pi Pico is sitting even and aligns properly with the PCB contacts<br>
6. Solder the remaining corners while lightly holding the Pi Pico down against the PCB to assure good contact <br>
7. If you were using tape to hold down the Pi Pico remove it<br>
8. Solder the remaining pins and check your work<br>
<br>

<br>

**Soldering the speaker to the amp** <br>
1. Feed the wire through the amp as shown in the picture above<br>
   Black is (-) and Red is (+)<br>
2. Solder the wires to the amp and trim excess wire lead<br>

<br>

**Soldering the amp to the PCB** <br>

3. Place the amp on the main PCB as shown and turn over PCB and lay flat on workspace<br>
4. Solder each connector and trim excess lead off<br>
<br>

<br>

**Soldering the Cable Connector to PCB** <br>


1. Place cable connector on PCB and turn board over<br>
2. Solder the header connector to the PCB and check work<br><br>

<br>

**Solder the Battery Connector to PCB** <br>
1. Place Battery Connector onto PCB and turn PCB over onto workspace<br>
2. Solder both connectors down to the pcb<br>
3. Verify Connector is flush to PCB<br>

<br>

**Solder the on/off switch to PCB** <br>
1. Place switch onto PCB and turn PCB over onto workspace<br>
2. Solder one of the larger pins to the pcb and turn over<br>
3. Verify switch is flush to PCB<br>
4. Continue soldering the remaining pins<br><br>


![20250125_095458](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17f5f27a-8949-4e9b-912c-902ad3ddf5e5)

<br>

**Solder the LCD to the PCB** <br>
<br>NOTE: Turn the board over as LCD is on the other side of PCB<br>
1. With the LCD sitting as flush as possible, Solder 1 pin and check <br>
2. Solder remaining pins of the LCD to the main PCB<br>
3. Trim off excess leads so there is no excess<br>
