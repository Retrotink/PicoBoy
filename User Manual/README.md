The PicoBoy uses a 2000mAh Lipo battery at 3.7V giving an average run time of around 8-10 hours.<cr>
When you plug in the PicoBoy USB to power, the LED light will show **RED** until fully charged<cr>
When charging is complete, the LED will change to **BLUE**.<cr>
<cr>
The PicoBoy on/off switch is a custom designed adapter printed on a 3D printer in ABS to be as strong as possible.<cr>
Sliding the on/off switch towards the center will turn on the PicoBoy. You will then be greated with listing of games on the SD Card.<cr>

<cr>
If you get a Red bar across the top, you either have no games, or the PicoBoy is not reading the SD card. <cr>
Try and use a smaller card formatted in **FAT32**. <cr>
To load a game, scroll up/down or left and right (for other pages if you have many games loaded) <cr>
Press **Button A** to choose the game. This loads the game into flash ROM. There is a life cycle of the number of times you can write to Flash ROM. <cr>
To extend the life of Flash ROM, if you wish to play the last game loaded, even after power off, just press **SELECT** <cr>
This feature only works if you have previously loaded a game into Flash ROM. <cr>
<cr>
## Playing a Game! <cr>
<cr>
Ok, you are ready to play that game. The game is loaded and started. The rest of the steps to continuing are the same as a Gameboy. <cr>
