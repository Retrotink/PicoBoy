The PicoBoy uses a 2000mAh Lipo battery at 3.7V giving an average run time of around 8-10 hours.<br>
When you plug in the PicoBoy USB to power, the LED light will show **RED** until fully charged<br>
When charging is complete, the LED will change to **BLUE**.<br>

The PicoBoy on/off switch is a custom designed adapter printed on a 3D printer in ABS to be as strong as possible.<br>
Sliding the on/off switch towards the center will turn on the PicoBoy. You will then be greated with listing of games on the SD Card.<br>
